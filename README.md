Handwritten Digit Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **classifying handwritten digits (0–9)** using
machine learning / deep learning techniques.

The goal is to train a model that can correctly recognize digits from
grayscale images based on pixel values.

The project uses the **MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset**, a benchmark dataset
widely used in computer vision and machine learning research.
